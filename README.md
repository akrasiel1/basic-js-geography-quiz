An interactive project built with HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap 4.3.1
Although basic in nature and simple in style, the UI has some degree of complexity. By using a form with a questionnaire,
the users submit their answers through a form, which in return shows the final percentage score. 
The score shows on top of the header and is animated like a timer.
